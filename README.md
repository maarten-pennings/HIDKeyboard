# HIDKeyboard
A small extra keyboard for a PC

## Introduction
I was inspired by Maker's Muse to make my own private keyboard.
Components I selected
 - [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-New-Pro-Micro-for-arduino-ATmega32U4-5V-16MHz-Module-with-2-row-pin-header/1871481789.html)
 - [Cherry switches](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10Pcs-3-Pin-KeyCaps-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switch-Blue-for-Cherry-MX-Switches-Keyboard-Replacement-Tester-Kit/32884614611.html)
 - Cherry switch key caps
 - Housing to be printed with Cetus3D
 - [USB HID software library from NicoHood](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID), which actually comes _with_ the Arduino IDE
 - The Arduino [application](ProMicroKbd)
 
The Arduino application is written by me in such a way that it should be easy to configure.
